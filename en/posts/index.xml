<p>In EVE-NG or GNS3 simulator, running the <a href="https://sonic.software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">SONiC KVM image</a> will leave a lot of settings after
booting. It&rsquo;s annoying to pull out a bunch of settings every time you boot a new machine.</p>
<p>In this situation, I would like to automate the solution ( computer science people =&gt; lazy), but it seems that I don&rsquo;t
need to use Ansible, pyATS, or Nornir yet. So I use shell script to solve it.</p>]]></description>

<hr>
<p>Following the previous article <code>ONIE Simple Introduction</code>, let&rsquo;s briefly share how ONIE is built!</p>
<p>This will be similar to a tutorial, but of course it&rsquo;s impossible to put company information here~ It&rsquo;s just a general
look at how a network equipment manufacturer makes this thing.</p>

<p>Honestly, the development environment is just a standard Linux machine, I use a virtual machine~</p>]]></description>

<p>If you have ever used a whitebox switch, you maybe know what Open Network Install Environment is ~
Here is a simple brief introduction to ONIE. The first task during my internship at Edge-core Networks was to make a new
device compatible with ONIE, which means making ONIE run on the new device.</p>]]></description>

    <title>ACS Custom Noise Cancelling Earplugs</title>
    <link>https://seisokeii.github.io/en/posts/earplug/acs-earplug01/</link>

    <description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
                <img src="/images/ACSEarplug/acs_earplug_box.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>I decided to share my experience since there aren&rsquo;t many people talking about this on internet.</p>
<p>So why did I want custom earplugs? Mainly because my friends often invite me to hardstyle nightclubs and music festivals
like Defqon.1, Intents, etc., and eardrums are very fragile. I don&rsquo;t want to lose my hearing so early QQ</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s another reason, which might be the bigger one, that sometimes I need to work on equipment in the network
room or server room, and sometimes I stay there for a long time, and the high-frequency fans are super noisy&hellip; For
these reasons, I wanted to find a way to protect my ears.</p>]]></description>

<p>The first post is dedicated to Hugo!</p>
<p>First of all, I have to say that my luck is really terrible&hellip; I read many articles on the Internet that said Hugo can
be set up in 5 minutes, but it took me a day (more than 20 hours) to get it done before I started writing this post&hellip;</p>]]></description>
